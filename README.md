## üó∫Ô∏è Overview

MinCED is a method developed by [Connor T. Skennerton](https://github.com/ctSkennerton) 
to identify [Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPRs)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CRISPR) 
in isolate and metagenomic-assembled genomes. It was derived from the CRISPR 
Recognition Tool [\[1\]](#ref1). It uses a fast scanning algorithm to identify
candidate repeats, combined with an extension step to find maximally spanning
regions of the genome that feature a CRISPR repeat.

Diced is a Rust reimplementation of the MinCED method, using the original
Java code as a reference. It produces exactly the same results as MinCED,
corrects some bugs ([minced#35](https://github.com/ctSkennerton/minced/issues/35)), and is
much faster. The Diced implementation is available as a Rust library for convenience.

*This is the Rust version, there is a [Python package](https://pypi.org/project/diced) available as well.*

### üìã Features

- **library interface**: The Rust implementation is written as library to facilitate reusability in other projects. It is used to implement a Python library using
PyO3 to generate a native extension.
- **zero-copy**: The `Scanner` which iterates over candidate CRISPRs is zero-copy if provided with a simple `&str` reference, but it also supports data behind smart pointers such as `Rc<str>` or `Arc<str>`.
- **fast string matching**: The Java implementation uses a handwritten implementation of the [Boyer-Moore algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boyer%E2%80%93Moore_string-search_algorithm)[\[2\]](#ref2), while the Rust implementation uses the `str::find` method of the standard library, which implements the [Two-way algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-way_string-matching_algorithm)[\[3\]](#ref3). In addition, the [`memchr`](https://crates.io/crates/memchr) crate can be used as a fast SIMD-capable implementation of the `memmem` function.

## üí° Example

Diced supports any sequence in string format.

```rust
let mut reader = std::fs::File::open("tests/data/Aquifex_aeolicus_VF5.fna")
    .map(std::io::BufReader::new)
    .map(noodles_fasta::Reader::new)
    .unwrap();
let record = reader.records().next().unwrap().unwrap();
let seq = std::str::from_utf8(record.sequence().as_ref()).unwrap();

for crispr in diced::Scanner::new(&seq) {
    println!("{} to {}: {} repeats", crispr.start(), crispr.end(), crispr.len());
    for repeat in crispr.repeats() {
        println!(" - at {}: {}", repeat.start(), repeat.as_str());
    }
}
```
