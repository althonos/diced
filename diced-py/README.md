## üó∫Ô∏è Overview

MinCED is a method developed by [Connor T. Skennerton](https://github.com/ctSkennerton) 
to identify [Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPRs)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CRISPR) 
in isolate and metagenomic-assembled genomes. It was derived from the CRISPR 
Recognition Tool [\[1\]](#ref1). It uses a fast scanning algorithm to identify
candidate repeats, combined with an extension step to find maximally spanning
regions of the genome that feature a CRISPR repeat.

Diced is a Rust reimplementation of the MinCED method, using the original
Java code as a reference. It produces exactly the same results as MinCED,
corrects some bugs, and is much faster. The Diced implementation is available 
as a Rust library for convenience.

### üìã Features

- **library interface**: The Rust implementation is written as library to facilitate 
  reusability in other projects. It is used to implement a Python library using
  PyO3 to generate a native extension.
- **single dependency**: Pyrodigal is distributed as a Python package, so you
  can add it as a dependency to your project, and stop worrying about the
  Prodigal binary being present on the end-user machine.
- **zero-copy**: The `Scanner` which iterates over candidate CRISPRs is zero-copy if 
  provided with a simple `&str` reference, but it also supports data behind smart 
  pointers such as `Rc<str>` or `Arc<str>`.
- **fast string matching**: The Java implementation uses a handwritten implementation 
  of the [Boyer-Moore algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boyer%E2%80%93Moore_string-search_algorithm)[\[2\]](#ref2), while the Rust 
  implementation uses the `str::find` method of the standard library, which 
  implements the [Two-way algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-way_string-matching_algorithm)[\[3\]](#ref3). In addition, the [`memchr`](https://crates.io/crates/memchr) crate can be used as a fast SIMD-capable 
  implementation of the `memmem` function.

## üí° Example

Diced supports any sequence in string format.

```python
import Bio.SeqIO
import diced

record = Bio.SeqIO.read("diced/tests/data/Aquifex_aeolicus_VF5.fna", "fasta")
sequence = str(record.seq)

for crispr in diced.scan(sequence):
    print(
        crispr.start,
        crispr.end,
        len(crispr.repeats),
        crispr.repeats[0],
    )
```
